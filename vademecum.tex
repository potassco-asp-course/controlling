\begin{frame}{What to use when\dots?}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \structure{embedded script}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item suitable for small amendments to the logic program,

      anything on the term level during grounding

    \item perform calculations that are hard or inconvenient to express in ASP
    \end{itemize}
    \smallskip
  \item \structure{module import}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item convenient way to use \clingo\ as part of a larger project
    \item provides high level functions to control grounding and solving
    \item surrounding application is in charge of the control flow and
      \\ ASP is used to perform specific computations
    \end{itemize}
    \smallskip
  \item \structure{application class}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item aims at building custom systems based on \clingo
    \item similar to module import but with more customization capabilities
    \end{itemize}

  \item<2-> []\structure{\itarrow} constitutes the cornerstone of many \clingo-based systems

%    \qquad such as \clingcon, \clingoM{dl}, \eclingo, and \telingo
  \end{itemize}
